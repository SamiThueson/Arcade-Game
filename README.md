# Overview

As an aspiring software engineer I would like to improve and keep up with skills I am acquiring. To do this I have made goals to work on different software projects that will challenge and inspire me.

For this project I had decided to make a game using python and the arcade library. The game I made is simple and does not require much skill to play. It starts out with a cubed slime player in the middle of the screen that can move around when the arrow keys are pressed. The object of this game is for the slime to collect all the coins on the screen. The game keeps track of the score and once all the coins are collected a game over screen appears. On the game over screen the total score is displayed as well as how long it took to play the game. If desired the space button can be pressed to start the game again.

Writing this software has helped me better understand object-oriented programming and how to use it. As well as the many different tools in the arcade library.

# Development Environment

For this game I used visual studio code as the ide to write code and test it. Visual studio code is easy to set up and works very well with python.

I chose to use python and the arcade library as the framework to develope the game. The arcade library is object-oriented and provides many tools to quickly get a game up and running. Arcade makes implementing graphics and sounds into your game very easy and efficient.

# Future Work

- Seperate the classes into different files, re-organize the game
- Make levels of difficultly
- Add sound effects and background music
- Add a menu screen
- Save players score and name
